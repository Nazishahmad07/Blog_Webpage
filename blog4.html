            Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of South Africa.Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman),
             a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and 
             property developer, who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.
            
            Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with his children sharing
             their father's dislike of apartheid.His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa 
             and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father. Musk later regretted his decision because he has become
