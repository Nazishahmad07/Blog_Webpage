         <p class="font1">Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be 
            retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of 
            sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.Borrowing 
            ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually 
            successful campaign for India's independence</p>
         <h2>Early life</h2>
         <hr>
         <p class="font1">Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second 
            of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, 
            taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.

            After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, 
            founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British 
            Indian government..</p>
