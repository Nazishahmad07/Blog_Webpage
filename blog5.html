         <p class="font1">Jeffrey Preston Bezos (born January 12, 1964) is an American entrepreneur, media proprietor, investor, and commercial astronaut. He is the founder, executive chairman, and former
             president and CEO of Amazon. With a net worth of US$114.5 billion as of November 2022, Bezos is the fourth-wealthiest person in the world and was the wealthiest from 2017 to 2021 according to 
             both Bloomberg's Billionaires Index and Forbes.</p>
         <p class="font1">Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986. He holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.
                 He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle. 
                 The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, 
                 cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is the world's largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the largest provider 
                 of virtual assistants and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.</p>
         <h2>Early life</h2>
         <hr>
         <p class="font1">Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964, the son of Jacklyn and Theodore Jørgensen. At the 
            time of Jeff's birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high school student and his father was 19 years old. Jørgensen was a Danish American and was born in Chicago to a family 
            of Baptists. After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school while bringing Jeff along as a baby.[20] Jeff attended a Montessori 
            school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he was two years old. After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April 1968. Shortly after 
            the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jeff whose surname was then legally changed from Jorgensen to Bezos.</p>
